# Do I have COVID-19 Quiz (in Bulgarian)

I've used a boilerplate React quiz solution from Mitch Gavin, explained in this [tutorial blog post](https://mitchgavan.com/react-quiz/).

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/mitchgavan/react-multi-choice-quiz).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Idea

This is NOT meant to be a tool for determining whether you're sick with COVID-19, but rather to inform the public of the main symptoms and what everyone should do if they experience any of them. Namely to stay at home and call their MD.
